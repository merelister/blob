# Blobble
## Inspiration

Why is developing financial literacy important for young women? 

Women experience unique financial struggles, in comparison to men, which include longer life expectancy, mid-career breaks, and wage gaps, making it necessary to have strong financial knowledge to be able to plan ahead and adapt to the future. However, women often feel intimidated or unaware of financial concepts due to a lack of exposure and resources, creating a gap in financial literacy. 

Investing in women is investing in the future. By 2030, it is estimated that women will inherit 70% of wealth, and it is crucial that our future generations learn how to properly manage these assets.

94% of young women play video games and enjoy mobile gaming experiences. Our platform provides an engaging and accessible space for them to practice and develop healthy financial habits. 

## What it does

Blobble helps to introduce young women to budgeting through gamification and personalized goals.

The design focuses on the user audience of girls aged 10-15. Through fun, glanceable and guided learning, Blobble helps young women (age 10-15) gain skills in budgeting. 


The player can start their financial goal through the following steps:
1. The user creates a Blobble to represent a financial goal they want to achieve. 
2. Users document their spending and savings, and their Blobble will respond to visualize the progress to their goals.
2. As the user saves more money towards their goal, the Blobble will grow in size.
3. By completing missions, the user can gain new character customizations, unlockable by building financial habits.
4. After completing a goal, the Blobble is sent to the Forest, acting as an archive. The user can refer to the specific goal and the money they spent and saved in order to reach the goal.
5. The user creates a new Blobble, starting another financial goal!
